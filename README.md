For live tracking feature we should modify "preferences" in the User Model:
```
addressCordinates: {
  type: {
    type: String,
  },
  coordinates: [Number],
  }
}
```

For pre set preferences in User Profile we should add this to the User Model:
```
preferences: {
	allergies: Array:String,
	address: {
		firstLine: String, 
		secondLine: String,
		city: String, 
		postCode: Number
	},
```
